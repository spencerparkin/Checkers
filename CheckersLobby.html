	<h2>Motivations/Impressions</h2>
	<p>
	This web-app was created as an exercise in learning JavaScript, Node.js, and various modules and frameworks
	surrounding these technologies.  Completely new to web-app development, I'm not sure I always made the best
	design decisions, and I'm not entirely confident the app would scale to many thousands of users; nevertheless,
	I'm fairly happy with how it turned out, despite some of the JavaScript-style coding practices that feel more
	like hacks to me than legitimate practices.  The UI/UX is far from perfect, but I will continue to improve it
	over time.
	</p>
	<p>
	Though I've come to find out that many are tired of opinions about Node.js, I can't help but add
	my initial impressions here.  I was initially drawn to Node.js, because I found the idea of not needing
	to learn yet another new language for server back-end programming an appealing prospect.  Having now
	gone through the effort to create a somewhat substantial Node.js application, I'm fairly confident that
	I would not want to implement and maintain a large and complex server-side system using nothing but
	JavaScript.  There are a few reasons that don't consider efficency or scalability at all.
	</p>
	<p>First, I find the JavaScript language
	to be quite querky.  It's fine for small client-side stuff, but I'm not excited about writing a large and complex
	application with it, but maybe I just need to learn it better?
	</p>
	<p>Second, JavaScript-based APIs have taken
	the asynchronous approach to an extreme.  Maybe we need this to get the best out of concurrency, but it's
	not always obvious to me that a callback can return without immediately providing a result.
	In cases where the poorly written API documentation can be understood, one is allowed to
	defer the result to yet another asynchronously called callback -- a closure created with the needed up-values
	taken from the original callback.  The callback chaining can get messy,
	especially if you need to do something only after two or more callbacks have completed.  API docs are almost
	never clear whether the result of a callback will be needed immediately after the callback is called.
	If the result is computed on an object passed by reference, then it can, I believe, be safely assumed that
	callback chaining is allowed and even encouraged for concurrency's sake.
	</p>
	<p>Lastly, I have to say that without
	<a href="https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector">node-inspector</a>,
	this project would have never succeeded.  As a developer, what's most important
	to me about a language, and what makes coding in it enjoyable, are the debugging tools available for it.
	Chrome's debugger is great, but I guess I've just been spoiled too much by the DevStudio IDE/Debugger which
	has some features I've yet to find in Chrome.  I'm sure Chrome's debugger is just going to get better, though;
	and I have yet to try fire-bug.
	</p>
